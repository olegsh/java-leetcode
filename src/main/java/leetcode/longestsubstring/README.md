## The Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string _s_, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

Example 1:

> **Input:** s = "abcabcbb"
>
>**Output:** 3
>
> **Explanation:** The answer is "abc", with the length of 3

Example 2:

> __Input:__ s = "bbbbb"
>
> __Output:__ 1
> 
> __Explanation:__ The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:

> __Input:__ s = "pwwkew"
>
> __Output:__ 3
>
> __Explanation:__ The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

Example 4:

> __Input:__ s = ""
>
> __Output:__ 0
